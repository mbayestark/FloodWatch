# 🌊 Floodwatcher

Floodwatcher is a digital storytelling and advocacy platform centered on the **flooding crisis in Wakhinane, Senegal**. Rather than focusing solely on prevention, this project empowers local residents to **share their experiences**, **attract external support**, and **promote tech-based solutions** to improve urban resilience.

## 🚨 Problem
